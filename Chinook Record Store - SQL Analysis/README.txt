CHINOOK DIGITAL MUSIC SHOP - ANALYSIS USING SQL

The Chinook database represents a fictional digital music shop, like an iTunes store. The database is provided as a SQLite database file called chinook.db.

The aim of this project is to explore the Chinook database using SQL and answer the following business questions:

Selecting new albums to purchase:Finding out which genres sell the best in the US
Analyzing Employee Sales Performance

Analysis for changing Purchasing Strategy

Python visualizations have been added to better visualize the results. This is a guided project from Dataquest.
